Amor A. Javier and Celestino E. Javier is the name of my parents. During that time, my father is a driver of her own Jeepney that day my mom was riding a jeep going home after school.
My dad saw my mother with her white school uniform, that they started my dad falling inlove with my mother. 
After that day, my dad had his confidence to start courting my mom. He always brings my mom to the school and also take my mom to their house by using my dad’s jeepney. 
After a month ago, my mom answers my dad to be his boyfriend. And that’s where they started. <P>
