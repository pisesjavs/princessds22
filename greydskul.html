My grade school, this was the year I started to make friends with others, I am originally from Nueva Ecija that where I took my Grade School. There are so much during that time, I started to have a crush during that Grade School days. I was so amazed that time because I experienced a lot of new things with my friends. I remember that my favorite place in our school is our School Canteen. 
I was also remembering the name of our school canteen worker her name is ate One, who always spoiled me in eating chocolates and Candies.<P>
